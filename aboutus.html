		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<body><h3>Barbara Thomas</h3>
<p>My name is Barbara and I make something out of nothing! My major is Web Design with Graphic Specialization. I am getting a late start in obtaining my degree. 
My kids are all grown and doing thier own things will schooling and jobs. I finally have the time to do something for me.
<br><br> I have been interested in building websites since the days of GeoCities, AngelFire, and the like. 
I loved typing what looked like gibberish and have it turn into an interactive web page with pictures and music! 
It was so gratifying when I got the code correctly written, I got a little rush every time.  </p>
<h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
<p>As I am taking this class, it is all coming back to me. The excitement of making something from nothing! 
I hope to use my degree and find a job that I can do something that I enjoy every day.  
I would like to help businesses, charities, and non-profit organizations with their internet presence. 
<br><br>I believe that with the degree I earn from <a href="https://brightpoint.edu"/>BrightPoint Community College</a> will help me reach my goals.</p>
